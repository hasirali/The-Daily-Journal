I’ve developed a dynamic platform for blogging, featuring live content updates, GitHub authentication, and blog submissions, with a clean and minimalistic design. The project showcases my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and modern web technologies while ensuring a seamless user experience.  
**Technology Used**: React 19, Next.js 15, Sanity, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, TypeScript  

### Features:
- **Live Content API**: Displays the latest blogs dynamically on the homepage using Sanity's Content API.
- **GitHub Authentication**: Enables users to log in easily using their GitHub account.
- **Blog Submission**: Allows users to submit blog posts, including a title, description, category, and multimedia links (images or videos).
- **View Blogs**: Lets users browse through submitted blogs with filtering options by category.
- **Blog Details Page**: Users can click on any blog to view its details, including multimedia and descriptions.
- **Profile Page**: Users can view and manage the list of blogs they’ve submitted.
- **Editor Picks**: Admins can highlight top blogs through the "Editor Picks" feature, managed via Sanity Studio.
- **Views Counter**: Tracks the number of views for each blog instead of using an upvote system.
- **Search**: Users can search and view blogs efficiently.
- **Minimalistic Design**: A fresh and simple UI with essential pages for ease of use and a clean aesthetic.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
